# HFSS Simulations

In this repository you'll find some simulations that I done for my master degree microwave networks classes. All projects were design in FR-4 substrate. 

## Waveguide

This folder is about a simple 50 Ohms waveguide

## Stub ressonator

This folder contains a microstrip stub ressonator with 950 MHz central frequency
